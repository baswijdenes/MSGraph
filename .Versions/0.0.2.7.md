# General
- **Devicecode Login** available now! (See [Connect-Mga](#Connect-Mga) for more)
- No more variables in the Global scope!  
  From now on variables needed by the module are saved to the script scope in 1 variable: `$script:MgaSession`  
  See [Get-MgaVariable](#Get-MgaVariable) for more

# New cmdlets
## Get-MgaVariable
- Since the global scope dissapeared you're unable to see the variables in the script scope. I've created the `Get-MgaVariable` for you to see the AccessToken etc
- See main README.md for more information

## Update-MgaVariable
- This cmdlet will be mostly used for testing purposes 
- With `Update-MgaVariable` you can update Variables to test several settings
- See main README.md for more information

## Get-MgaPreview
- This is a Preview version for `Get-Mga`
- Updated `Invoke-WebRequest` to `Invoke-Restmethod` for more optimization (he he)
- If all works well this will eventually become `Get-Mga`
- See main README.md for more information

# Updated cmdlets
## Connect-Mga

- DeviceCode uses MSAL where DeviceCodePreview will retrieve a token from the Microsoft EndPoint 
- Use DeviceCodePreview when you need an automatic refresh (RefreshToken)
- See main README.md for more information

## Disconnect-Mga 
- Disconnect-Mga got updated to remove the `$script:MgaSession` from the script scope
